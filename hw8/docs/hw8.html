<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
In this assignment, you will practice refactoring. In the first part of the assignment
you are given working but quite ugly and "smelly" code. Your task is to refactor and augment
the code. In the second part you will refactor your old homework code. 
</p>


<h2 id="Problem1">Problem 1: Willy Wazoo's Boolean Expressions [70 points]</h2>
<p>
  Willy Wazoo has written a program that parses, evaluates and prints boolean expressions,
  and his code works! The parser takes a string expression in preorder form and constructs
  a boolean expression tree (the one we did in class). In preorder, the operator (AND, OR) 
  appears before the two operands of the expression; e.g., <strong>x AND y</strong> is <strong>AND x y</strong> 
  in preorder, and <strong>x AND y OR z</strong> is <strong>OR AND x y z</strong> in preorder. 
  We restrict AND and OR to two operands. The example from lecture, <strong>(x OR true) AND y</strong> translates to 
  <strong>AND OR x true y</strong> in preorder. 
  Note that in preorder one need not worry about order of operations. 
  The reason why Willy chose preorder, is that it is much easier to parse an 
  expression if it is in preorder form, than if it is in the "normal" inorder form. 
</p>

</p>
  We have added Willy's code in <tt>src/hw8/</tt> and his test cases in <tt>src/hw8/test</tt>.
  Willy's code parses, evaluates in a context of variable-to-boolean mappings, 
  and prints the expressions. It prints the expressions in preorder and in inorder. 
  Printing in inorder is a little bit more involved because one must take into account
  order of operations and insert parentheses when needed. In boolean arithmetic 
  NOT has highest precedence, followed by AND, followed by OR. 
  If the preorder expression is <strong>AND OR x y z</strong>, this should be printed as 
  <strong>(x OR y) AND z</strong> in inorder, to account for the fact that operand <strong>y</strong>
  associates with the OR. <strong>x OR y AND z</strong> is equivalent
  <strong>to x OR (y AND z)</strong>, <strong>OR x AND y z</strong> in preorder. 
</p>

<p>
  Willy's code works fine, except that he forgot to implement the NOT expression! He tried to add 
  a NOT, but quickly became frustrated beause it required too many changes throughout
  the code.  
</p>


<p>
Your task is to fix Willy's code. You must identify all code smells, refactor
and implement NOT and still pass all Willy's tests.
List all code smells you identify in <tt>hw8/answers/problem1.txt</tt>.
List all refactorings you use in <tt>hw8/answers/problem1.txt</tt> as well.
Ideally, your refactored code will include a Boolean expression hierarchy, 
as shown in the figure below, and will make use of the Interpreter or Visitor
design patterns.

<h2 id="Problem2">Problem 2: Resubmit [28 points]</h2>
  
<p>
Refactor and resubmit HW4 and HW5. You should elminate (at least) 
the large method, large class and duplicate code smells (if you haven't done so already). 
Briefly describe the changes in <tt>hw8/answers/problem2.txt</tt>.
</p>

<p>
If your HW4 and/or HW5 received low grades but you managed to make things work this time, 
you will receive 10 points towards HW4 and/or HW5.
</p>

</p>


<h2 id="reflection">Reflection [1 point]</h2>

<p>Please answer the following questions in a file named <tt>reflection.txt</tt>
in your
<tt>answers/</tt> directory.  Answer briefly, but in enough detail to
help you improve your own practice via introspection and to enable the
course staff to improve Principles of Software in the future.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In retrospect, what could you have done better to reduce the time you
  spent solving this assignment?</li>
  <li>What could the CSCI 2600 stuff have done better to improve your learning
  experience in this assignment?</li>
  <li>What do you know now that you wish you had known before beginning the
  assignment?</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration [1 point]</h2>
<p>Please answer the following questions in a file
named <tt>collaboration.txt</tt> in your
<tt>answers/</tt> directory.</p>
<p>
The standard academic integrity policy applies to this assignment.
</p>
<p>
State whether or not you collaborated with other students.
If you did collaborate with other students, state their names and a brief
description of how you collaborated.
</p>

<h3 id="other-hints">Refactoring</h3>

<p>
Remember, the key to refactoring is, make a small change then immediately 
run the tests. That way, if you break something you'll know exactly where 
to look.  
</p>


<h2 id="Turnin">What to Turn In</h2>
<p>You should add and commit the following files to SVN:</p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>hw8/*.java</tt> <em>[The refactored Boolean expression code. Add as many files as you need.]</em></li> 
    <li><tt>hw8/test/*Test.java</tt> <em>[JUnit test classes you edit or create]</em></li>
    <li><tt>hw8/answers/problem1.txt</tt></li>
    <li><tt>hw8/answers/problem2.txt</tt></li>
    <li><tt>hw8/answers/reflection.txt</tt></li>
    <li><tt>hw8/answers/collaboration.txt</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, commit changes to <tt>hw4</tt> and <tt>hw5</tt>.</p>
